It should be possible to set user credentials in a config file.

The app should then have following functionality:
• Fetch and display Released This Week songs - Use the API path new-releases
• Fetch and display Featured Playlists - Use the API path featured-playlists
• Fetch and display Browse genres - Use the API path categories

Please apply some styling.
I would expect some tests on your code.
